                        <p>When it was launched in March 2011, the Nintendo 3DS was hailed as a revolution with its
                            glasses-free 3D display, but its high initial price was met with reluctance from consumers.
                            The first few weeks were challenging, and sales levels anticipated.</p>

                        <h3>Price Management</h3>
                        <p>Nintendo was quick to react to the market's reactions. On 28 July 2011, the company took a
                            decisive decision by significantly reducing the price of the Nintendo 3DS. This price
                            revision paved the way for wider adoption, removing the financial barriers that had held
                            back early sales.</p>

                        <p>To appease early adopters who had bought the console at the higher initial price initial
                            price, Nintendo introduced the "Ambassador" programme. Members of this programme, having
                            purchased the 3DS before the price adjustment, were rewarded with free access to classic
                            Game Boy Advance classic Game Boy Advance games and other benefits, reinforcing the
                            relationship between the relationship between the company and its community of gamers.</p>
